CUinSPACE Simulated Flight - README
Overview
This is the CUinSPACE Simulated Flight program! This application is designed to simulate the management of rocket subsystems using a multithreaded architecture. The simulation involves multiple systems consuming and producing resources while a central manager oversees the overall operation. The program demonstrates key programming concepts, including dynamic memory management, multithreading, synchronization using semaphores, and priority-based event handling.

This README will guide you through compiling, running, and understanding the program.

Instructions to Compile the Program
To compile the program, you will need a linux machine that has a GCC compiler. Follow these steps to build and run the program:

Ensure All Source Files Are in the Same Directory:

The following files should be present:

main.c, system.c, manager.c, resource.c, event.c

Header file: defs.h

Makefile

Compile Using make:

Run the following command:
    - make


This will create an executable file named cuinspace.

Run the Program:

Execute the compiled program with:
    - ./cuinspace


Clean Up Build Artifacts:

To remove object files and the executable:
    - make clean


Optional Debugging and Memory Check:

To test for memory leaks and invalid memory usage, use:
    - valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./cuinspace

Questions and Assumptions
Input and Output Behavior
Input Format Assumptions:

The program assumes that the data for resources and systems is correctly formatted when loaded. For example, all resource names are strings, and initial amounts are integers.

Event Queue Processing:

Events are processed in a priority-based manner. If multiple events have the same priority, they are processed in the order they were added.

System Status Changes:

Systems automatically adjust their statuses (e.g., SLOW, FAST, TERMINATE) based on resource availability and events.

Debugging Support
Debug Messages:

Debugging statements are included throughout the program to trace execution and identify issues. These messages can be enabled or disabled by toggling the DEBUG macro.

Edge Cases
Critical Resource Depletion:

If critical resources like oxygen or fuel are fully depleted, the program terminates the simulation with a relevant message.

Resource Capacity Management:

Systems respect the maximum capacity of resources and handle overflow gracefully by generating events.

Usage Tips - Helpful things we found when running!
Debugging Mode:

Enable detailed debug logs by ensuring the DEBUG macro is set to 1 in the source files.

Disable debugging by setting DEBUG to 0 before final submission or production use.

Simulating with Different Data:

The simulation can be customized by modifying the load_data function in main.c to add new resources or systems with different characteristics.

Error Handling:

The program includes detailed error messages for invalid operations, such as failing to allocate memory or reaching invalid system states.

Project Specifications
Development Environment:

Developed and tested on a Unix-based system using GCC as the compiler.

Multithreaded behavior tested using standard threading libraries available in the development environment.

File Dependencies:

Ensure all source files (main.c, manager.c, system.c, resource.c, event.c) and the header file (defs.h) are present in the same directory for successful compilation.

Threading and Synchronization:

Each system operates in its own thread, synchronized with semaphores to ensure safe access to shared data (e.g., EventQueue, Resource).

Stress Testing:

Test cases include scenarios with multiple high-priority events, concurrent resource usage, and simultaneous system activity to verify thread safety and event handling.
